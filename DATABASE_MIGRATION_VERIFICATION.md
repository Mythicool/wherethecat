# Database Migration Verification Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you verify that the database migration for anonymous reporting and geolocation functionality has been applied correctly.

## Step 1: Run the Database Migration

### In Supabase SQL Editor, execute:
```sql
-- Migration script to enable anonymous cat reporting
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor if you have an existing database

-- Step 1: Add reporter_type column to cats table
ALTER TABLE cats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reporter_type TEXT DEFAULT 'authenticated' CHECK (reporter_type IN ('authenticated', 'anonymous'));

-- Step 2: Make user_id nullable (this will update existing constraint)
ALTER TABLE cats ALTER COLUMN user_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- Step 3: Update existing records to have reporter_type = 'authenticated'
UPDATE cats SET reporter_type = 'authenticated' WHERE reporter_type IS NULL;

-- Step 4: Drop existing RLS policies for cats
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own cats" ON cats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own cats" ON cats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own cats" ON cats;

-- Step 5: Create new RLS policies that support anonymous reporting
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert their own cats" ON cats
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id AND reporter_type = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Anonymous users can insert anonymous cats" ON cats
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id IS NULL AND reporter_type = 'anonymous');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own cats" ON cats
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND user_id IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own cats" ON cats
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND user_id IS NOT NULL);

-- Step 6: Update storage policies to allow anonymous photo uploads
CREATE POLICY "Anonymous users can upload cat photos" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'cat-photos' AND (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL OR auth.uid() IS NULL));

-- Step 7: Create index for reporter_type for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS cats_reporter_type_idx ON cats(reporter_type);
```

## Step 2: Verify Database Schema

### Run these verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if reporter_type column exists and is configured correctly
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'cats' AND column_name IN ('user_id', 'reporter_type');

-- Check existing data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_cats, reporter_type 
FROM cats 
GROUP BY reporter_type;

-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'cats';
```

### Expected Results:
1. **Column Check**: Should show `reporter_type` as TEXT with default 'authenticated'
2. **Data Check**: All existing cats should have `reporter_type = 'authenticated'`
3. **Policy Check**: Should show the new RLS policies for anonymous and authenticated users

## Step 3: Re-enable Reporter Type in Code

### After successful migration, uncomment this line in `src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
// In handleAddCat function, change this:
const newCatData = {
  ...catData,
  user_id: user ? user.id : null,
  // reporter_type: user ? 'authenticated' : 'anonymous', // Temporarily disabled until DB migration
  latitude: locationToUse.lat,
  longitude: locationToUse.lng,
  status: 'active'
}

// To this:
const newCatData = {
  ...catData,
  user_id: user ? user.id : null,
  reporter_type: user ? 'authenticated' : 'anonymous',
  latitude: locationToUse.lat,
  longitude: locationToUse.lng,
  status: 'active'
}
```

## Step 4: Test Functionality

### Test Anonymous Reporting:
1. **Open app without signing in**
2. **Click "Use My Location" button** (should appear on map)
3. **Grant location permission** when prompted
4. **Verify GPS location** is detected and displayed
5. **Fill out cat form** and submit
6. **Check database**: New record should have `user_id = NULL` and `reporter_type = 'anonymous'`

### Test Authenticated Reporting:
1. **Sign in to the app**
2. **Click "Use My Location" button**
3. **Submit cat report**
4. **Check database**: New record should have your `user_id` and `reporter_type = 'authenticated'`

### Test Geolocation Features:
1. **Map Button**: "Use My Location" button appears on map
2. **Form Button**: "Use My Location" button appears in cat form
3. **Permission Handling**: Graceful error messages for denied permissions
4. **Accuracy Display**: Color-coded accuracy indicators in form
5. **User Location**: Blue dot appears on map with accuracy circle
6. **Auto-Center**: Map centers on user's location
7. **Auto-Form**: Cat form opens at user's location

## Step 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "reporter_type column not found"
- **Cause**: Migration not run or failed
- **Solution**: Re-run the migration script
- **Verification**: Check column exists with verification query

#### 2. "Permission denied for anonymous users"
- **Cause**: RLS policies not updated
- **Solution**: Re-run policy creation part of migration
- **Verification**: Check policies with verification query

#### 3. "Geolocation not working"
- **Cause**: HTTPS required for geolocation
- **Solution**: Ensure app is served over HTTPS
- **Note**: localhost works for development

#### 4. "Location permission denied"
- **Cause**: User denied permission or browser settings
- **Solution**: Clear browser permissions and try again
- **Fallback**: Manual map clicking still works

### Error Messages to Watch For:

#### Database Errors:
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: "Could not find the 'reporter_type' column"
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: Successful cat report submission
- ‚ùå **Problem**: "Permission denied" for anonymous users

#### Geolocation Errors:
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: "Location access was denied" (user choice)
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: "Geolocation is not supported" (old browsers)
- ‚ùå **Problem**: JavaScript errors in console

## Step 6: Verification Checklist
